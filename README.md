* Art & Design showcase utilising Shopify Integration, exploring graphic design principles - colour theory, layout design and typography.

* I have created the background graphics with GLSL shaders and React Three Fibre. The effect is created with a Fractal Brownian Motion function, and uses a mouse movement event listener to interact with the colours.

* Deployed using Netlify, I have integrated Netlify forms to collect customer queries. I have used the Shopify Buy Button to enable sales through my site, and a carousel feature to easily view my work. 

* The website is fully responsive and styled with Tailwind, taking modern UX design trends into account.



### Built With

* React Three Fibre
* GLSL
* Adobe Creative Suite
* Javascript
* Tailwind
* Figma
